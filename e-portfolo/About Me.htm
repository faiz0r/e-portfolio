<h1>About Me</h1>
    
<!-- Here is my p tag with inforamtion about me -->
    
<p><br>My name is Faizan Zaheer and I am currently studying in my first year at the Manchester Metropolitan University I am currently studying 4 units which includes Programming, Web development,
Information Systems and Computer System fundamentals. Previously before this year I did a foundation year
which tested my skills in basic fundamentals of maths and computing.
</br>

<br>
I have always had an interest in computing during my teenage years, and most of my brothers have gone down the same route of becomeing Software Engineers and Computer Scientists and have taught me a little bit about some of the things in which they do and even told me about the many proffesions in which a person in this field can go into which immediately sparked confidence in working towards this ambition, at first I really wanted to jump into the role of a game developer programming systems for games but now have a thing for web development because of how easy HTML & CSS is and have hopes in the future to implement many other coding languages withing my projects.
</br>

<br>
I am born and raised in Manchester, I hope to move to a country that is nice and warm and have a special interest in culture and love to picture myself living in a place I enjoy visiting.
</br>

<h2>Action Plan</h2>
My action plan during my academic career is to focus on achievming my goals and to hand in any work before its due
hand in date so that I can focus on other work so that i can achieve the best mark that i possibly can, to do this
i will need to break down my tasks so that they can be achievable rather than unrealistic and focus on things step
by step. I will need to prioratise my time so that the more important things are done first rather than last
especially the easy tasks.
