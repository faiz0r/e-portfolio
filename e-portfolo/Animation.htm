<p>Some of the things i enjoy about HTML and CSS is seeing how things actually work
and to actually develop those things in real time and to work seamlessly with the
hardware and software in the future, HTML is an enjoyable and creative way into getting
into the fundamentals of programming here are a few websites I use to brush up my skills
with HTML, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> and 
<a href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda.</a></p>
