<h2>Information Systems</h2>

    <!-- Here is my first paragraph talking about the Informaiton Systems Unit -->
	
<p>In our Information Systems unit we are currently involved in a group project where each member of our
members will have to contribute towards a group project which consists of developing a database for a
bike rental company that is currently using an inefficient method on taking in information from its customers
which includes orders, payments and their details like address etc. all of this information will be saved
with his current paper based system but now he wants a computer based system where he can save and update
information. During the development of this system we will need to work as a group to develop a report and
then to design the database system which will then be followed up with a presentation, In the first
screenshot you can see a Use Case Diagram which will highlight all the different roles in a business and what
they will be doing, which is then followed up by an Entity Relationship Diagram which is another graphical
representation of the diferent entities and their relatipship to each other, which will alow us to organise the
data.</p>

<h2>Web Design and Development</h2>

<p>In Web Design and Development we are currently learning HTML and CSS we have worked on a few templates
in order for us to practice and get good at using the language the first being to create a multimedia
website for the university we then moved onto our assignment where we have to develop an e-portfolio which
is what this currently is. In the first screen shot you can see a video followed by its code of Java Script
which is a language that will allow us to change the function of the videos playback so that we can
have many different features like play pausing and slowing and speeding up the video, which is then followed
by my HTML and CSS.</p>
