  <!-- Here is my first paragraph talking about the Programming and Computer Systems Fundementals -->
  <p>
    In Programming we have learned the programming language of Java, at the moment we are getting
    eased into the language by creating shapes and learning about procedures and different variables so that
    they can be adjusted in size and looped into different patterns, we have then used this knowledge to 
    create mini games that the user can interact with using the keys, as you can see in the first screen shot
    we had developed a pong game using delta commands so the user can move the bat up and down and had given the
    ball code so that it can bounce against the wall and back towards the bat. And in the second game we have
    gone with the same prinsibles but instead have added a collition code where the rocket known as the defender
    once it makes contact with the defender will then stop and the user will have to start again in order to
    continue.

  <h2>
    Computer Systems Fundamentals
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    In Computer Fundamentals we are learning about logic gates and practising them in a software called
    logisim, we are now using this software to create a seven segment display as part of our assignment
    and are also using command line code in another software called Mars to develop a menu system that stores
    functions in a register and using different command lines of code to do different things such as multiplying
    and dividing etc.
